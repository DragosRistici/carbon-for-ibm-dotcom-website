### What is Carbon for IBM.com?
Carbon for IBM.com is the resource for the community of designers, developers, and anyone involved in building IBM web pages and digital experiences. Its goal is to implement the IBM Design Language, which expresses IBM's brand values across all customer touch points, not just the web. 

### What is Carbon?
Carbon Design System aka [Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com) is how the IBM Design Language is implemented across IBM products. Carbon is the strategic solution for Carbon for IBM.com replacing [v18](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/v18/design/), [v19a](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/faq.html) and even older versions like v17. In Q4 2019, Carbon for IBM.com will work with Carbon to produce themes, components, patterns and guidelines to leverage IDL for IBM.com's more expressive nature.

### Which codebase should you use?
If you are designing a new page or doing a re-design on a page, get started with [Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com) and get familiar with the new grid first. If you are maintaining or updating a site, use v18 until the release of Carbon for ibm.com in 2019. If you are with IBM Cloud and Watson marketing, [v19a](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/faq.html) will continue for limited use until Drupal adopts Carbon in 2020.

### What components are not ready in Carbon and when will they be ready?
Typography for 16px buttons and text are not ready yet in Carbon. Masthead, Footer, Horizontal rule and ibm.com services like Tealium tags, search, metrics and other web elements are not ready in Carbon. As components are finished they will be rolled out throughout Q4 2019 and into 2020.

### What happened to Duo?
“Duo” was the codename for the redesign and revamp of the IBM Design Ethos and Language. This effort is still being carried out today throughout all of IBM Design. The new IBM Design Ethos and Language is directly influencing the evolution of Carbon for IBM.com.

### Where can I get current information on updates, timelines, and migration?
* For current information on system updates, see the [Homepage](#). A listing of components, elements, and guidelines with updates are listed there as well. Updates are tracked over time beginning with the most recent.
* For details on individual component, element, and guideline updates, see each page listed.
* For current information on timelines and migration, see the updates shown on the [Roadmap page](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library/wiki/Roadmap).


### Where can I find guidelines for designing or coding IBM pages?
* For guidelines as a designer, see [Designing](/../getting-started/designing).
* For general code/development, see [Coding](/../getting-started/coding).
* For guidance regarding overall expression, review the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/).
* See specific guidelines and component usage requirements, along with examples, within each individual element or component, such as the use of grids, buttons, or anything else.
* We will also be adding additional examples throughout the site.

### What is the relationship between Carbon for IBM.com and the Carbon Design System?
Historically, Carbon had focused more on product design at IBM, while Carbon for IBM.com focused on IBM.com online experiences. Now both systems will be merging to create a single IBM Design System that will deliver more robust, cohesive experiences for the entire IBM ecosystem.

### How can I contribute and/or propose new components/ideas?
Please open an [issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library/issues/new/choose) and include as much detail as possible in the issue to ensure we understand the context and desire for this proposal. We will prioritize these based on feasibility and user impact. Additional contribution guidelines are coming soon.

### I see a bug, how do I report it?
Please open an issue in our [Github repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library/issues/new?assignees=emerson-pereira%2C+jacobottesen-dgc&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md). We will address the bug as soon as we can. If you have a fix for the bug, please feel free to submit a PR for it in the correct Github repository.

### Where do I go if I've read everything and still have an issue/question?
Ask on the [#ibm-digital-design](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/messages/C2PLX8GQ6) Slack channel or open an issue in our [Github repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library/issues/new/choose).

### When will the themes and components available in Carbon for ibm.com use?
We are working on the integration detail, we will provide updates on our homepage by the end of Q3.
