<PageDescription>

A lead space is positioned at the top of a web page and serves as the first site of viewer engagement; its primary purpose is to orient the user when they land on a page and to help them decide whether to continue reading or not as well as orient themselves. 

</PageDescription>

## Overview

When designed and implemented effectively, the lead space can be used to engage visitors immediately in one of the most important moments in the user's journey through a complex web environment. It is the first full-width section below the masthead and can include a stylized background, headline, supporting message and call to action to accommodate user needs. 

## Lead space left-aligned
Can include a title, supporting copy, double CTAs and a background image.

## Lead space centered
Can include a title, supporting copy, double CTAs and a background image.

### Research findings

### Developer notes
When viewing the [LeadSpace stories](https://deploy-preview-78--ibmdotcom-patterns-react-experimental.netlify.com/?path=/story/leadspace--default-with-image), the knobs to toggle the buttons’ aspects are different for each story due to storybook knob limitations. In the no image story, button text and links can be modified or buttons can be removed entirely by setting the "buttons" knob to an empty array `[ ]`. Notice when editing the “renderIcon” field, the button icons do not reload hence in the image story, there are dropdown selectors to toggle the button icons. When using the LeadSpace, please follow the button structure in the no image story.

For further developer guidance view the LeadSpace README [here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library/blob/master/packages/patterns-react/src/patterns/LeadSpace/README.md).
