### Interested in contributing to Carbon for IBM.com? This design system is the result of community contributions, large and small--of code, design, ideas, and guidance. Here's how you can contribute too.

## Introduction

Carbon for IBM.com is for IBM.com creators only to building webpages on IBM.com, and the Carbon for IBM.com community is always working to make it better. Contributors like you help to make Carbon for IBM.com great, and so we're glad you're here.

Contributions are not limited to code. We also encourage feedback, documentation, new designs, and tools.

All you need is a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/join) to get started. Most contributions begin with a GitHub issue using one of these templates:

- [Ask a question](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+question+%3Aquestion%3A&template=question.md&title=)
- [Report a bug](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+bug+%F0%9F%90%9B&template=bug-report.md&title=)
- [Request a feature](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement+%F0%9F%92%A1&template=feature-request-or-enhancement.md&title=)

## Working in the open

Carbon for IBM.com lives on GitHub. All work, discussion, issues, bugs, features, improvements, and comments can be viewed on GitHub. As we mentioned, you'll need a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/join) to contribute.

If you're looking for something that we don't have, or you notice something could be improved, you have two options:

1. **Open an issue for the request.** We'll review the issue and get back to you with next steps. If we decide the request should be part of our pipeline, we'll add it to our roadmap. There are never timeline guarantees for requests, but we'll do our best to give you an estimate.

2. **Begin the work yourself and contribute it back to Carbon for IBM.com.** We appreciate complete contributions but also works in progress. You're welcome to open an issue to surface your work and we'll weigh in and help where we can.

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, we encourage you to open an issue as early as possible in the process.

If working with GitHub sounds like a lot, check out [this free video series](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github). It's one of our favorite resources.
