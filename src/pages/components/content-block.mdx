description:
  Content block is a high-level content component that acts as the  content unit used inside a content section to build
  web experiences on IBM dotcom. It encapsulates other content components (one or multiple content groups) and brings
  them together into a custom visual which solves a specific problem for the user.

## Overview

The content block component can be used and customized for different types of web experiences. It can be used multiple
times inside a content section component, acting as a main content unit for it.

<br />

1. **Heading:** Customizable heading for the content block component.
2. **Description:** A short description of the content block.
3. **Children container 1:** Use this to insert other high-level content units, like content groups.
4. **CTA text link or CTA card link:** Use this component as a general call to action at content block level.
5. **Children container 2:** This container is only used to insert aside elements, or a link list to the content block.

#### When to use

Use content block when you need to organise a web page experience into high-level content units inside of a content
section. One of the advantages of the block is that it is visually very prominent on the page through its big heading
type token and its’ accompanying description. Use it inside of a complex content section to hierarchically separate
different content units for an easier read and understanding.

#### When not to use

Do not look at content blocks as a replacement for content sections. A page is separated into sections, which, in turn,
are separated into blocks. Do not use a content block to only separate content items, or other related basic content
units like paragraphs inside of a web page. Use a content group instead.

## Behaviors

The content block elements are persistent throughout the online experience. It is fully responsive and changes how
elements are displayed based on the browser size.

#### Desktop breakpoints (max, xlg, and lg)

If the browser is wider than the max breakpoint of 1584px, the content block and all other page content will center and
extra margin will appear on either side of the page layout. The content block is recommended to take the last 12 columns
of the grid (12 of 16). From this 12 columns, the block heading, description, children container 1 and the CTA will take
the first 8 grid columns (of the last 12), and the children container 2 will take the last 4 grid columns.

In more particular editorial experiences, when there is no children container 2, it is possible to layout a content
block on 4 columns, making the reading experience in certain situations more delightful and more story-like.

<Row>

<Column colMd={4} colLg={12}>

</Column>

</Row>

#### Md and sm breakpoints

At medium and small breakpoints, the content block will add a significant change: the children container 1 will move
above the content block CTA and the children container 2 will move at the bottom of the content block. See below.

### Showcase

This is a showcase of a content block that encapsulates a content group with aside elements, alternating with a content
block which encapsulates a card group of four cards.

## Tips and techniques

The content block elements are persistent throughout the online experience. It is fully responsive and changes how
elements are displayed based on the browser size.

- Important: keep in mind that on medium and small breakpoints, the children container 1 is positioned between the
  content block description and the CTA text link.
- Avoid CTA stacking at the end of a content block. If possible, use different types.
